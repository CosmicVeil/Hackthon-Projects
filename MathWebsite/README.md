We have designed a app which provides users with math questions, in a simple and efficient manner. 

Our website works in a couple of steps: 

  - On our websites main page, users can enter a topic they want questions in, and the number of questions they want.
  
  - When users get their questions, they can click a solution button to see the solution for every question

  - Users can also click an option on the bottom, which provides them with 3 options: if the questions was a good difficulty, too hard or too easy

  - If they click a certain difficulty, we adjust the next question by keeping a score for the difficulty of questions they can solve


Our website uses the OPEN AI API to get the questions and solve them. We use Python's Flask module to create the backend, and a combination of HTML and CSS to create the frontend.
