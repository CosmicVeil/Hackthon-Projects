We have designed a app which provides users with math questions, in a simple and efficient manner. 

Our website works in a couple of steps: 

  - On our websites main page, users can enter a topic they want questions in, the number of questions they want, and the grade level they want them in(difficulty).
  
  - When users get their questions, they can click a solution button to see the solution for every question


Our website uses the OPEN AI API to get the questions and solve them. We use Python's Flask module to create the backend, and a combination of HTML and CSS to create the frontend.
